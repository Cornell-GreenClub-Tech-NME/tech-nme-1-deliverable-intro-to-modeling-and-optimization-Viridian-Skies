    "Our current project involves creating a map with all of our stakeholders. We might be able to apply linear programing to optimize deliveries of compost from  (similar to asphalt). I think for future projects, it would be really cool to see if we can better optimize food waste by working with restaurants to predict demand. Additionally, I think it would be cool to try to model other aspects of food waste, not necessarily with linear programming, but trying to estimate how much each facility produces within a day.\n",
